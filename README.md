Influence Line Creator

This Project is for dynamic influence line calculations. Normal Shear and Moment diagrams graph the force effect at 'x' point 
on the beam while a load P is placed at point 'c' on the beam, where 'x' is a variable and 'c' is a constant. A normal Influence Line diagram graphs 
the force effect at 'c' point on the beam while the load 'P=1 unit' is placed at a point 'x' on the beam, where 'x' is a variable and 'c' is a constant. 
what this program does is easily create an influence line diagram based on user inputs, while also allowing the user to effectively use 'c' as a variable as well.
the user can slide 'c' along the beam length and the program will generate new influence lines in real time. The total behavior of a beam under a moving load 'P'
can be understood in seconds.
